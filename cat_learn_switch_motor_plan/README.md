## cat learn switch motor plan
This project examines category learning while switching on a
psuedo-random trial-by-trial basis between between sub-tasks
that require 100% incongruent / conflicting
stimulus-response mappings.

It follows from Crossley et al. (in prep) which showed that
learning while switching between such sub-tasks can occur
but apparently only if the response keys used within each
sub-task were distinct.

- sub-task 1 required S-R associations {S-R1, S-R2}
- sub-task 1 required S-R associations {S-R3, S-R4}

Learning did not occur / was severely impaired if the same
response keys were used in both sub-tasks.

- sub-task 1 required S-R associations {S-R1, S-R2}
- sub-task 1 required S-R associations {S-R1, S-R2}

It therefore appears that unique motor plans (i.e., as
implied by unique response keys) are required to faciliate
learning while task switching.

However, it is unlearn in this context what exactly
constitutes a "motor plan". In particular, is it critical
that unique motor effectors (e.g., fingers) be used, unique
goal positions (e.g., response key), or both?

This honours project seeks to shed light on this question.
